HeartyPatch is a completely open source, single-lead, ECG-HR wearable patch with HRV (Heart Rate Variability) analysis. It is based on the popular ESP32 system-on-a-chip.

If you don't already have one, you can buy one on [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/protocentral/heartypatch) campaign page. We have started shipping them out to backers.

# Getting Started with HeartyPatch

If you just want to use the HeartyPatch with the pre-loaded firmware, it comes ready to go. You do not have to do any programming to get it working.

With the preloaded firmware, the HeartyPatch will do heart-rate and R-R interval measurement and send it over BLE through a standard [Heart-rate BLE service](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml), as well as a separate custom HRV service that will provide parameters used for HRV analysis such as SD, Mean RR, PNN50 and SDNN.

**HeartyPatch can be used with any Android app that supports the heart-rate profile.**

## The HeartyPatch App for Android - BETA

An android app for HeartyPatch is now available that receives and displays the real-time heart rate as well as HRV trends and variables. The app scans for any HeartyPatch devices in the vicinity and shows a list of devices accessible through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Please note that you would need an Android device with BLE support to use this app.

You can download and install the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protocentral.heartypatch) in the following link:

*Note: The android app for HeartyPatch is still in BETA and there might be some instability as a result.*
